# Emulated Philips Hue Bridge for Homeassistant 

<b>Important Note:</b> Under development. Current version does not work (yet)

## Summary
This project emulates the functionality of a Philips Hue Bridge and can be used in conjunction with Homeassistant. 
The application uses the Homeassistant entities (light.*) and allows control and sharing via the Philips Hue v2 API.
- Works with the official Philips Hue app ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.philips.lighting.hue2&hl=de&gl=US&pli=1), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/philips-hue/id1055281310)) and other third-party apps that are compatible with the v2 API



## Disclaimer
Core structure and concepts (especially REST API v2 implementation) heavily based on [diyHue](https://github.com/diyhue/diyHue).
